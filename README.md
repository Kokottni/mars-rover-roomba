# CPRE 288 Mars Rover Development

All programming for this project was done in C in Code Composer Studio.

Throughout the semester we added on more and more, progressing from Lab 1 to Lab 10.

The final project has all of the project files to be used for the overall application of a roomba that would navigate autonomously to a position surrounded by four skinny pillars on a test field.
